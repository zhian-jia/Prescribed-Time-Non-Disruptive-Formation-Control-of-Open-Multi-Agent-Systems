# Prescribed-Time-Non-Disruptive-Formation-Control-of-Open-Multi-Agent-Systems via Information Isolation
A simulation code for a paper submitted to IEEE TIE

Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 correspond to two simulation cases. The comparison methods labeled “-Auto” and “-TAC” refer to the approaches in [1] and [2], respectively. The file “Main.m” is the main simulation program.
